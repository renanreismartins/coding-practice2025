# Coding exercises 2025 ðŸ’»

A repository for coding practice in 2025.
The purpose of this repository is to deliberately practice coding â€” focusing solely on computer science concepts or interview-style problems. No commercial, open source, or production-style code.

**I'm not aiming for state-of-the-art solutions â€” solving the challenge is enough, neither formal unit testing.**
